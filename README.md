# Sorting Algo Visualizer

## Overview

[Sorting Algo Visualizer](https://kevinyieh.github.io/sorting_algo_visualizer/) is an application that (surprise surprise) visualizes sorting algorithms. It is meant to assist people in understanding how sorting algorithms work. It's also just something really satisfying to watch at max speed and max buckets (checkout out the [app](https://kevinyieh.github.io/sorting_algo_visualizer/)) to see what I mean!
